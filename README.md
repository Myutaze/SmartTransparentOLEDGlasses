# Smart Transparent OLED Glasses
Smart Toled Glasses that displays Weather and Currency Exchange Data over bluetooth


This was a fun project to do.

The idea is that we have a smartphone connected to our smart glasses through bluetooth. Our smartphone uses wifi/cellular data to retrieve information about the weather of the city you live in and display Currency Exchange information. We will also implement a home security feature as in like if there is a thief in our house we will be alerted that there is an intruder. The intruder alert system can be considered as when the sensor detects an intruder, then it will send over the internet to our smartphone and then to our smart glasses via bluetooth.


For this project we use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and an Arduino.

The Raspberry Pi 3B+ side will be our smartphone that retrieve data about the Weather and Currency Exchange from the Internet and also act as if its the sensor at home for the Intruder alert then send it through Bluetooth to our Arduino and then display the info on the Transparent OLED Screen. 



Here is an overview of how it is proceeded:
