# SmartTransparentOLEDGlasses
Smart Toled Glasses that displays Weather and Currency Exchange Data over bluetooth


This was a fun project to do.

The idea is that we have a smartphone connected to our smart glasses through bluetooth. Our smartphone uses wifi/cellular data to retrieve information about the weather of the city you live in and display Currency Exchange information.


For this project we use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and an Arduino.

The Raspberry Pi 3B+ side will be our smartphone that retrieve data about the Weather and Currency Exchange from the Internet and then send it through Bluetooth to our Arduino and then display the info on the Transparent OLED Screen.
